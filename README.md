# linkback README

This vscode extensions provides commands to open files in a remote git repository. This has been tested with gitlab and github urls, but it should support other urls out of the box, as well.

## Features

### Vscode Commands

#### Linkback: Open File in Repo

Open the current file in a remote git repository. This is provided as a command in the vscode Command Palette, as well as on the right-click context menu.

#### Linkback: Open Selection in Repo

Open the current file _and_ editor selection in a remote git repository. This is provided as a command in the vscode Command Palette, as well as on the right-click context menu (only when text is selected).

## Requirements

The files must be contained inside a git repository that has a remote url configured.

**Enjoy!**
